# The Cabin
    
The front of the small cabin is entirely 
occupied with navigational instruments, a 
radar display, and radios for calling 
back to shore. Along each side runs a 
bench with faded blue vinyl cushions, 
which can be lifted to reveal the storage 
space underneath. A glass case against 
the wall contains several fishing rods.

Scratched windows offer a view of the 
surrounding bay, and there is a door 
south to the deck. A sign taped to one 
wall announces the menu of tours offered 
by the Yakutat Charter Boat Company.`))
